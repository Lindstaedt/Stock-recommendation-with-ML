# Stock recommendations with Machine Learning

## Installation
This project is using the Anaconda distribution of Python version 3.7. Libraries used are Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, TA-Lib (https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib), and Pandas Datareader. For development testing, PixieDebugger (https://pixiedust.github.io/pixiedust/install.html) was used as well. A free key from Quandl.com is required to load historical stock data.

## Project Motivation
This project is the capstone project of my completion of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

The goal is to build tool that can make trading recommendations for stock purchases. The analysis will explore ways to use historical stock data with technical analysis as inputs to machine learning algorithms.

## Structure

1. Loading historic stock data from Quandl
2. Building data set for training
 1. Strategy definition
 2. Additional feature generation
 3. Reshaping data for training set
3. Machine Learning


## File Descriptions
 - trader.ipynb - the main program
 - confidential-API-key.txt - not included in the GitHub repo - a file containing my personal Quandl API key
 - A forthcoming summary writeup of the results will be published on Medium.com
