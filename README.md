Stock recommendations with Machine Learning

Installation
This project is using the Anaconda distribution of Python version 3.7. Libraries used are Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, TA-Lib (https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib), and Pandas Datareader. For development testing, PixieDebugger (https://pixiedust.github.io/pixiedust/install.html) was used as well. A free key from Quandl.com is required to load historical stock data.

Project Motivation
This project is the capstone project of my completion of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

The goal is to build tool that can make trading recommendations for stock purchases. The analysis will explore ways to use historical stock data with technical analysis as inputs to machine learning algorithms.
